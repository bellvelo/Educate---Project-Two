PROBLEM - Global Warming.

INTRO - Global warming (source: bbc)
Although the temperature increases have been gradual, most, but not all, scientists agree that the climate is getting gradually warmer. This is called global warming.

Most, but not all, scientists lay the blame for this on human activities increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Global warming could cause climate change and extreme weather conditions in some areas.

Climate change may make it impossible to grow certain food crops in some regions. Melting polar ice, and the thermal expansion of sea water, could cause rising sea levels and the flooding of low-lying land. Extreme weather events become more likely due to increased convection accompanied by more water vapour being present in the hotter atmosphere.

SOLUTION - Renewable Energy (source: scholarschools.net)

Renewable energy is sustainable and will never run out. They provide clean energy because they are non-pollutant and non-contributor to greenhouse effects and global warming. Renewable energy facilities generally require less maintenance than traditional generators. Their fuel being derived from natural and available resources reduces the costs of operation.

Renewable energy produces little or no waste products such as carbon dioxide or other chemical pollutants, so have a minimal impact on the environment. Unlike coal, renewable energy pays off its carbon footprint and does so relatively quickly. Depending on where they are made, solar panels offset their carbon footprint in about four years.

Renewable energy projects can also bring economic benefits to many regional areas, as most projects are located away from large urban centres and suburbs of the capital cities. These economic benefits may be from the increased use of local services


Q. Which Region is the largest investor in renewable energies?
A. 1-China, 2-Europe, 3-Asia & Oceania, 4-USA.

CARBON FOOTPRINT
1. air mile = 24.040 grams of C02.
2. car mile = 404 grams of C02.
3. bike mile = 0 grams of C02.

The average person's carbon footprint is about 10 tonnes, which is equivalent to filling 24 million balloons with carbon.

The world's population produces 16 million tonnes of carbon emissions every 24 hours, of which the UK alone is responsible for 13%.

If we were to plant a forest with the aim of offsetting the UK's carbon emissions, the forest would need to cover the entire area of the UK and half as much again.

Only 7.5% of the UK's energy comes from renewable (green) sources.
